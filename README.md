# 1.Introduction 
What is Time Series?,It is the Sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals.The main reason for time series analysis is for preparatory step before we develop a forecast of a time series.

# 2.Steps to conduct a Time Series Analysis
   * Importing time series in Python
   * Visualizing a time series
   * Patterns in Time Series
   * Addictive & Multiplicative Time Series
   * Time Series Decomposition
   * Stationary & Non-stationary Time Series
   * Make Non-stationary to stationary
   * How to make a time series stationary
   * Making the Time Series Stationary
 
 # 3.Forecasting a Time Series
After Time Series stationary, making models on time series is easy because it is easy to add the error, trend & seasonality back into predicted values.

* Method called ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
* Similar to Linear Regression e.g., depends on parameter
    * p (AR) Auto Regressive
    * q (MA) Moving Average
    * d (Amount of differences /Number of Non-Seasonal differences).
* RSS value (Residual sum of squares)
* Arima works best with a single dependant variable
* Linear regression works best with more than one dependant variable.
